# Employee Tech Support Analysis – DS_C2_SC3

This project was developed as part of a data science technical challenge from the HackerEarth Hackathon 2020. It focuses on merging, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing employee-related data combined with IT support ticket information.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The data consists of four CSV files:

- `test.csv` and `train.csv`: Employee demographic and organizational data.
- `test2.csv` and `train2.csv`: IT department data, including operating systems and ticket usage.

All records include a unique `Employee_ID` which is used to join the datasets.

## 🎯 Objective

- Combine multiple datasets using `pandas`.
- Clean missing or inconsistent values.
- Analyze key metrics related to system usage and support tickets.
- Export analysis results into an Excel file with multiple sheets.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Google Colab
- Google Drive (file storage)
- PyDrive (to share the output Excel file publicly)

## 📊 Key Insights Extracted

- Percentage of employees by desktop operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux, or unregistered)
- Percentage of employees by mobile OS (iOS, Android, or unregistered)
- Average age by desktop OS
- Average education level by desktop OS
- Total number of support tickets generated by desktop OS

## 📦 Output

The final result is an Excel file (`DS_C2_SC3_JosueVillalobos.xlsx`) containing:

- `Porcentaje_PC`: OS desktop usage distribution
- `Porcentaje_Movil`: Mobile OS usage distribution
- `Edad_Promedio`: Average age per desktop OS
- `Nivel_Educativo`: Average education level per desktop OS
- `Tickets_PC`: Total desktop support tickets per OS

## ▶️ How to Run

To replicate this project:
1. Upload the 4 CSV files to a folder in your Google Drive (e.g., `/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/DS_C2_SC3`)
2. Open the Colab notebook
3. Run all cells

The notebook mounts your Drive, processes the data, generates the Excel, and uploads it to Drive with a public link.
